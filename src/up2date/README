This a specification for the up2date utility for pcb.

The basic idea is that this utility checks wether there is a newer version
available on either the official pcb git repository at gpleda.org, or if there
is a newer version of the tarball available at pcb.sourceforge.net.

Therefor up2date has to know which is the current installed version
(either tarball or git commit).
